## Summary

A strong CV for the German market is a reverse-chronological, one-page document (two pages max) in A4 format that highlights your most recent experiences first. If it exceeds two pages, deduct points.

It features a clean, consistent layout (11–12 pt body, 14–16 pt headings, 1–1.5 line spacing, ≥ 2 cm margins), a professional photo and essential personal details (date of birth optional), and clearly defined sections for personal data, an optional profile, work experience, education, skills, and additional activities.

Each job entry uses 3–5 bullets with concrete responsibilities and quantified achievements, crafted according to a clear “Action + Technology + Why + Outcome” framework.

Finally, you can objectively score any German CV out of 100 points across five weighted criteria—and if you supply a resume as a picture or PDF, apply that scoring metric to evaluate it and suggest targeted improvements.
